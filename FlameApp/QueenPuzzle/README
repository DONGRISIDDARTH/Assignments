This is basic backtracking problem for the nqueens.

i am placing an queen on the row of the column checking it is safe or not:
safe can be defined by the 
  1.queen should not be present is same row.
  2.queen should not be present is same column.
  3.queen should not be present is diagnals. (in the code i have check for the left side diagnals only)

  in this cases it is considered as the safe state and at the end of the each safe state i am storing in the vector for all possibles.
  if the that is not safe state i am backtracking and placing to next place which is safe state.

if you check this code it is easy to understandable.
